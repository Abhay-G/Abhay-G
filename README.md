I am a 3rd Year undergraduate student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. I aspire to be a valuable resource in society; help develop software that is going to meet individual client needs. Being a team player with strong analytical and problem solving skills I come up with creative solutions for complex problems.I believe in constant learning and exploring new things; wish to travel the world and explore everything.
